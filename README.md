# stepik_interactive_sql_simulator
Most of the steps in the course are hands-on tasks for creating SQL queries. Each step includes minimal theoretical aspects on databases or SQL language, examples of similar queries and an explanation of the implementation.  The Stepik platform is used to create, execute and debug SQL queries; you don't need to install anything else on your computer.  Complexity of the queries increases as the course progresses. First they are formulated for individual tables, and then for databases developed for the subject areas, such as "Internet Shop", "Testing", "Applicant". And during the course steps, practical problems from the chosen subject area are solved.  Each student can make up their own tasks to create SQL-queries. The course has a module where the best of them are placed.  This course is designed to teach the student to create databases and implement queries to them in SQL language for different subject areas.
